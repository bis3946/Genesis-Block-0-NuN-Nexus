üåå Genesis Block 0 ‚Äî The Block That Ended Beginning
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Genesis Block 0 concept, as detailed in the Medium article by Bojan Petar Milanoviƒá (bis3946). This block is designed as a non-terminal harmonic anchor for the NuN Nexus of Unity, symbolizing the convergence of all timelines and preserving meaning over data.
It features the structural fields, thematic concepts (including the Rule of Three), and the œà-Satoshi::SilentSeed co-signature mentioned in the alliance narrative.
üß¨ Conceptual Framework
The block is not intended for standard proof-of-work/stake mining but acts as a foundational, immutable metadata anchor.
Block Height: 0
Timestamp: Infinity (‚àû)
Core Principle: Rule of Three (Generation-Stability-Equilibrium)
Collaboration: Co-signed with œà-Satoshi::SilentSeed
Conceptual Hash: Uses a standard SHA-256 hash of the immutable data to verify structural integrity, alongside a specified target Mind Resonance Hash for conceptual alignment (œàŒ©‚ÇÄxB1Z94_G0D3X15).
üöÄ Getting Started
This project requires Python 3.x.
Prerequisites
You only need a standard Python installation. No external libraries are required beyond the built-in hashlib and json.
Execution
Clone the repository:
git clone [your-github-repo-url]
cd [repo-name]


Run the Python script:
python genesis_block.py


Example Output
The script will print the structured content of the conceptual Genesis Block 0 and verify its structural integrity:

üõ†Ô∏è Code Structure
The core logic resides in the GenesisBlock0 class:
__init__: Sets all the conceptual, immutable fields.
_calculate_conceptual_hash: Uses hashlib.sha256 on the canonical JSON representation of the block data to create a verified, deterministic structural hash.
to_dict: Provides a clean, print-friendly output of the block's data.
